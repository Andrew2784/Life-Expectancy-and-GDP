# Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing data about life expectancy and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on six different countries. The data is from the World Health Organization and the World Bank and is in the all_data.csv file. The main code file is in the life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb Python notebook.

The data was preprocessed so that it would be ready for data analysis. Several questions were asked including the relationship between life expectancy and GDP. The main finding was that as GDP increased, life expectancy generally increased. These results were expected.
