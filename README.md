# Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing data about life expectancy and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on six different countries. The data is from the World Health Organization and the World Bank and is in the all_data.csv file. The main code file is in the life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb Python notebook.

The data were preprocessed so that it would be ready for data analysis. Several questions were asked including the relationship between life expectancy and GDP. The main finding was that as GDP increased, life expectancy generally increased. These results were expected. There were also significant differences in life expectancy between the six countries.

Overall, this project served as a great learning resource for learning more about data science and the steps involved in data analysis. I will continue to do independent projects because I enjoy doing them and learning more about data science.
